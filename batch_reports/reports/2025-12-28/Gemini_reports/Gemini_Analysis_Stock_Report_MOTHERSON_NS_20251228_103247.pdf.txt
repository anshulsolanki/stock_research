This analysis is conducted from the perspective of a positional equity trader focusing on a 1-4 month time horizon.

### Step 1: Audit the Data
*   **Data Present:**
    *   Price Action: 3-year daily price chart and recent daily price/volume data.
    *   Moving Averages: EMA 20, 50, and 200 with trend status.
    *   Momentum Indicators: RSI (14), MACD (12, 26, 9), and Supertrend.
    *   Volatility: Bollinger Bands (20, 2) and Volatility Squeeze/ATR analysis.
    *   Relative Strength: Detailed RS analysis vs. the Nifty Auto Index (^CNXAUTO).
    *   Fundamentals: 4-year long-term and 6-quarter short-term growth metrics.
*   **Data Missing:**
    *   Weekly/Monthly charts: Essential for confirming the structural "big picture" for a multi-month trade.
    *   Volume Profile/Delivery Data: To identify where the "smart money" has accumulated.
*   **Confidence Level:** **High.** The report provides a deep technical and fundamental overlay, though the lack of weekly timeframes is a minor limitation for positional trading.

### Step 2: Analyze the Setup
*   **Trend Direction:** The stock is in a confirmed **Strong <b><font color='#27ae60'>Uptrend</font></b>**. Price is trading above the EMA 20, 50, and 200. A Golden Cross occurred in September 2025, and the Supertrend remains on a "Buy" signal.
*   **Price Structure:** After a significant correction from late 2024 to early 2025 (dropping from ~140 to ~80), the stock has formed a steady recovery base. It is currently testing local resistance around the INR 120-INR 122 level (near the Upper Bollinger Band).
*   **Momentum:** There is a minor conflict in momentum. While the RSI is healthy at 58, there is a **<b><font color='#c0392b'>Bearish</font></b> Divergence** noted on Page 16 (Price made a higher high recently while RSI did not). The MACD histogram is also slightly negative (-0.30), suggesting the current upward move is losing some steam in the very short term.
*   **Relative Strength:** While the stock is a "Weakening Leader," its short-term RS (1M and 3M) is > 1.0, indicating it is currently outperforming the Auto sector index.
*   **Fundamentals:** Solid. 3-year Revenue CAGR of 21% and Net Income CAGR of 63% provide a strong "backstop" for long-term price appreciation.

### Step 3: Formulate the Recommendation

**Recommendation: NO (Immediate Entry)**
*Reason:* The setup is valid, but the current entry at INR 119.29 is "chasing" into immediate resistance (Upper Bollinger Band at 122.33) while a <b><font color='#c0392b'>Bearish</font></b> RSI Divergence is present. For a 1-4 month horizon, a better risk-reward entry is found on a minor pullback to support or a definitive breakout.

**Conditional Plan (Pullback Entry):**
The stock is structurally sound. We will look to enter on a "retest" of the short-term mean to ensure a better Risk/Reward ratio.

*   **Condition to Buy:** Limit order on a pullback to the EMA 20 or a successful bounce off the EMA 50.
*   **Entry Price:** INR 117.50 - INR 118.00
*   **<b><font color='#c0392b'>Stop Loss</font></b>:** INR 112.50 (Placed below the EMA 50 and the current Supertrend value of 113.55).
*   **<b><font color='#27ae60'>Take Profit</font></b>:** INR 136.00 (Near previous major structural resistance, representing a ~15% upside).

**Risk-Averse Note:** If the price closes below INR 113 on a daily basis, the intermediate-term bullish thesis is invalidated, and the trade should be avoided or exited immediately.

# News & Analyst Targets
As a stock research analyst, I have compiled the latest developments for **Samvardhana Motherson International Ltd. (MOTHERSON)** for the week of December 22-28, 2025. 

The primary driver for the stock this week is a significant strategic acquisition in Europe, which signals a major expansion of the company's wiring harness portfolio.

### 1) Latest News for MOTHERSON (Dec 22-28, 2025)
*   **Strategic Acquisition of Nexans Autoelectric:** On December 22, 2025, the Board of Directors formally approved the acquisition of 100% of the global wiring harness business of **Nexans autoelectric GmbH** for an enterprise value of **€207 million** (approx. INR 1,900+ crore).
*   **Expansion into PV Wiring Harness:** This move is highly significant as it marks Motherson's major entry into the **Passenger Vehicle (PV)** wiring harness segment globally. Historically, the company had a stronger presence in the Commercial Vehicle (CV) wiring segment; this acquisition bridges that gap.
*   **Financial Impact:** The acquisition is expected to be **cash EPS accretive** from the first year. Nexans Autoelectric reported revenues of ~€749 million in 2024, with a strong presence in Europe, North Africa, and North America.
*   **Deal Timeline:** The transaction is expected to close by **Q1 FY27**, pending regulatory approvals and consultations with works councils in Germany.

### 2) Brokerage Upgrades & Downgrades
*   **Motilal Oswal (MOFSL):** Reassigned a <b><font color='#27ae60'>BUY</font></b> rating on December 23, 2025. They highlighted that the Nexans deal strengthens Motherson's relationship with premium German OEMs like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
*   **Recent Downgrades (Early December Context):** In early December 2025, a domestic brokerage (likely Kotak) downgraded the stock from 'Add' to **'Reduce'**, citing expensive valuations and potential margin pressures in the global automotive supply chain despite the series of acquisitions.
*   **Citi:** Continues to maintain a <b><font color='#c0392b'>SELL</font></b> rating, though they recently raised their target slightly, reflecting a cautious view on the global recovery of the auto sector.

### 3) Indirect & Macro Impacts
*   **US Tariff Uncertainties:** The market is closely monitoring potential **US tariffs (up to 25%) on truck imports**. Since Motherson is a key supplier to Daimler Trucks in North America, any trade friction could impact its CV component volumes.
*   **Global Auto Slowdown:** There is a noted slowdown in dealer shipments in India and Europe as OEMs manage high inventory levels. This "de-stocking" phase is putting temporary pressure on the revenue growth of tier-1 suppliers like Motherson.
*   **Premiumization Trend:** On a positive note, the increasing electronic content in vehicles (ADAS, Cockpit electronics) continues to benefit Motherson's "Vision Systems" and "Wiring Harness" divisions, which command higher margins than traditional components.

### 4) Latest Analyst Targets (December 2025)

| Brokerage / Analyst | Recommendation | Target Price (INR) | Date of Report |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Motilal Oswal** | Buy | INR 129 | Dec 23, 2025 |
| **Trendlyne Consensus** | Neutral/Hold | INR 131.40 | Dec 2025 |
| **Domestic Brokerage** | Reduce | INR 170 | Dec 09, 2025 |
| **Citi** | Sell | INR 85 | Dec 2025 |
| **MarketsMojo** | Hold | - | Dec 2025 |
| **TipRanks (Avg)** | Moderate Buy | INR 120 | Dec 2025 |

**Analyst Summary:** The sentiment is currently **mixed**. While long-term bulls point to Motherson's aggressive "Vision 2025" ($36B revenue goal) and strategic M&A like Nexans, cautious analysts are concerned about the "acquisition fatigue" and the volatile global geopolitical environment impacting margins. The stock currently shows strong technical momentum, trading near its 52-week highs.
