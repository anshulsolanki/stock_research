(GODREJCP.NS)", "recommendation": "HOLD", "confidence_score": 8, "reasoning": "The stock is currently at a 'make or break' inflection point, testing critical support at the 200-day EMA (1180.49) while being trapped below immediate resistance at the 20 and 50-day EMAs. Although a 'Golden Cross' indicates a positive long-term shift, the short-term trend is bearish with a 'Sell' signal from the Daily Supertrend and negative MACD momentum. A 'Wait for Confirmation' approach is recommended, requiring a daily close above INR 1,200 to validate a reversal before initiating a buy.", "filename": "Detailed_Analysis_Stock_Report_GODREJCP_NS_20260207_102621.pdf"}
{"stock_name": "MARUTI.NS", "recommendation": "HOLD", "confidence_score": 8, "reasoning": "The stock is currently testing a critical long-term support level at the 200-day EMA, but the short-term trend remains firmly bearish with the price below the 20 and 50-day EMAs and a Supertrend 'Sell' signal. While volume suggests selling exhaustion, the report explicitly recommends a 'WAIT' stance until the price proves it can reclaim the 20-day EMA (~15,410) to confirm a valid reversal. Entering at the current market price of 14,997 is considered high risk due to weak relative strength and negative momentum histograms.", "filename": "Detailed_Analysis_Stock_Report_MARUTI_NS_20260207_103246.pdf"}

This setup is supported by a bullish MACD crossover and a significant surge in volume\u2014770k versus a 436k average\u2014which suggests institutional accumulation. While the weekly trend remains bearish and candlestick analysis indicates near-term 'Seller Control', the tactical swing trade offers a favorable risk-reward ratio targeting the 6150-6200 levels.", "filename": "Detailed_Analysis_Stock_Report_HEROMOTOCO_NS_20260207_103439.pdf"}
{"stock_name": "Axis Bank (AXISBANK.NS)", "recommendation": "HOLD", "confidence_score": 8, "reasoning": "While the stock maintains a strong long-term uptrend with moving averages aligned (20>50>200), the short-term indicators suggest exhaustion and a high probability of a pullback. Specifically, the MACD shows weakening momentum, five distribution days have been flagged indicating institutional selling, and the 'No Control' candlestick classification reflects current market indecision. The report advises waiting for a more favorable risk-reward entry at the 20-day EMA support (INR 1315-1320) rather than entering at the current price.", "filename": "Detailed_Analysis_Stock_Report_AXISBANK_NS_20260207_102409.pdf"}

While there are signs of selling exhaustion and bullish RSI divergences, the immediate price action is classified as 'No Control,' suggesting a lack of buyer conviction. The report explicitly advises staying on the sidelines until a daily close above INR 2145 validates a breakout and rules out a rejection at current levels.", "filename": "Detailed_Analysis_Stock_Report_COLPAL_NS_20260207_102730.pdf"}

While a significant volatility squeeze indicates a violent move is imminent, the bearish Supertrend across multiple timeframes and the presence of institutional 'distribution days' suggest the path of least resistance remains lower. The report explicitly advises against new entries at the current price, suggesting existing investors hold while new participants wait for a confirmed breakout above INR 921.", "filename": "Detailed_Analysis_Stock_Report_ZYDUSLIFE_NS_20260207_103150.pdf"}

While long-term support at the 200-day EMA (1126.61) provides a safety net, bearish momentum in the MACD and a neutral RSI suggest immediate entry is risky ('falling knife').

Strong fundamental growth, including a 37% YoY EPS increase and a strategic Japanese acquisition, supports the bullish thesis despite a bearish MACD divergence. The setup offers an excellent risk/reward ratio of 2.6, targeting 130.00 while maintaining a strict stop-loss at 113.50 to manage weekly timeframe risks.", "filename": "Detailed_Analysis_Stock_Report_MOTHERSON_NS_20260207_103518.pdf"}

Technical analysis shows 'Sell' signals across multiple timeframes (Weekly and Daily Supertrend) and the presence of multiple 'Distribution Days' indicates institutional selling.

Momentum is strongly negative, with a daily Supertrend SELL signal triggered on February 4th and a bearish MACD crossover below the zero line. Additionally, fundamental weakness is evident from a 10.97% drop in short-term Net Income and rising institutional distribution days, leading to a 'Sell on Rise' outlook.", "filename": "Detailed_Analysis_Stock_Report_INFY_NS_20260207_102826.pdf"}
