The presence of five distribution days in January 2026 suggests institutional profit-taking, making current entry risky. A more favorable entry point is identified between INR 1030 and INR 1040 during a projected mean-reversion pullback.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_SBIN_NS_20260131_112157.pdf"}

The recommendation is to wait for a price drop into the 5800-5850 support zone (confluence of EMA 200 and Weekly Support) and look for a rejection candle before entering.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_PERSISTENT_NS_20260131_113351.pdf"}
