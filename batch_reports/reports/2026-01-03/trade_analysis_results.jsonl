{"stock_name": "UltraTech Cement (ULTRACEMCO.NS)", "recommendation": "BUY", "confidence_score": 7, "reasoning": "UltraTech Cement offers the best risk-adjusted setup in the report, with a high proprietary score of 4.00 and an RSI of 60.20, which is described as the 'Goldilocks' zone for momentum. It is flagged with both 'Emerging' and 'Turnaround' signals, suggesting a fresh leg of growth compared to overheated sector leaders in Metals and Auto. The recommendation provides a clear entry range (11,899 - 11,950) with a defined 10% upside target and a 5.5% stop-loss.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Weekly_Report_20260103_123246.pdf"}
{"stock_name": "Lupin Limited", "recommendation": "BUY", "confidence_score": 8, "reasoning": "The stock is in a confirmed uptrend with a bullish EMA alignment (20 > 50 > 200) and is currently consolidating in a 'High Tight Flag' pattern. A volatility squeeze is signaled by an exceptionally low Bollinger Band width (0.0413), indicating a high probability of an upside breakout. Strong support is identified at 2028 (Supertrend) and 2060 (50 EMA), providing a favorable risk-to-reward ratio for entry between INR 2105 - 2115.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_LUPIN_NS_20260103_124557.pdf"}

Technical indicators are aligned with a bullish MACD and a healthy RSI of 66.67, suggesting room for further momentum before reaching extreme levels. Despite high fundamental valuations and mediocre relative strength, the technical breakout and strong export growth data override these concerns for a projected 5-10% tactical swing trade.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_BAJAJ-AUTO_NS_20260103_123346.pdf"}
{"stock_name": "Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (TORNTPHARM.NS)", "recommendation": "HOLD", "confidence_score": 8, "reasoning": "While the stock is in a robust long-term uptrend supported by a 'Golden Cross' and positive MACD momentum, the current price is technically overextended, trading above the Upper Bollinger Band on low volume. The report explicitly rejects an immediate entry (Decision: NO) due to high exhaustion risk and a low valuation score (28.0). It suggests waiting for a 'mean reversion' pullback to the 20-day moving average support zone between INR 3805 and 3820 to achieve a better risk-reward ratio.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_TORNTPHARM_NS_20260103_124526.pdf"}
{"stock_name": "Marico Limited (MARICO.NS)", "recommendation": "BUY", "confidence_score": 9, "reasoning": "The stock is in a confirmed strong uptrend, trading above all major EMAs (20, 50, 200) and recently breaking out from a multi-month consolidation zone. The technical setup shows high confluence with a fresh Supertrend buy signal, positive MACD momentum, and a volatility expansion following a Bollinger Band squeeze. Additionally, fundamental tailwinds such as 'high twenties' revenue growth in Q3 FY26 and a 30% correction in Copra prices provide a robust catalyst for further upside toward the INR 820 target.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_MARICO_NS_20260103_124153.pdf"}

Entering at the current price of 1266.90 risks buying into a rejection; the professional approach is to wait for a confirmed daily close above 1276 to align all indicators. Once this hurdle is cleared, the setup provides a clear path to an INR 1,380 target with a well-defined stop loss at 1,235.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_AXISBANK_NS_20260103_123812.pdf"}

While MACD shows short-term consolidation, the bullish RSI and tightening Bollinger Bands suggest an imminent price expansion within a bull flag pattern. Fundamentals are improving with accelerating Net Income and EPS, further supported by an 'Emerging Leader' relative strength status and recent brokerage upgrades.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_TECHM_NS_20260103_124347.pdf"}

(UBL.NS)", "recommendation": "HOLD", "confidence_score": 9, "reasoning": "The stock is currently in a strong downtrend and is described as a 'falling knife,' trading below all key moving averages (EMA 20, 50, and 200). While the RSI indicates oversold conditions at 32.02, there is no technical evidence of a bottom forming or a structural reversal occurring yet. Fundamental pressures, including negative EPS growth and regulatory headwinds in states like Karnataka, suggest staying on the sidelines until a daily close above INR 1,675 is achieved to confirm the selling has exhausted.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_UBL_NS_20260103_123626.pdf"}

Technical indicators are highly aligned with a bullish MACD crossover, a strengthening RSI, and active Bollinger Band squeeze signals suggesting an imminent price expansion. These technicals are backed by strong fundamental catalysts, specifically a +81.29% QoQ net income growth and strategic expansion moves in the African market.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_VBL_NS_20260103_124054.pdf"}

Furthermore, the stock is flagged as expensive with a valuation score of 31/100 and is trading 4.2% above the average analyst consensus target, making a fresh entry unfavorable until a retracement to the 50-day EMA support occurs.", "filename": "Gemini_Analysis_Stock_Report_EICHERMOT_NS_20260103_124649.pdf"}
